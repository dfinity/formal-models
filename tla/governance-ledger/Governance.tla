A high-level model of the interaction between the governance and the ledger canisters.
The goal is to analyze the interleavings from multiple parallel calls to governance/ledger.
We're using PlusCal (aka +CAL) - more precisely, its C syntax - to specify the canister calls, as it takes care of process counters and local state in a readable fashion.

What's been modelled so far:

- the claim_neuron call
- (spontaneous) ledger transfers between user accounts
- ledger responses to balance queries

Note that the model currently deadlocks, due to a infinite loop in the ledger canister that we use to respond to calls to this canister.
This loop gets starved once no further calls are made.
Thus, turn off deadlock checking in TLC when analyzing this.

Running TLC
***********

Here's how to invoke TLC from the command line (e.g., on the server):

java -cp <path-to-tla2tools.jar>  \
    -Dtlc2.tool.fp.FPSet.impl=tlc2.tool.fp.OffHeapDiskFPSet \
    -Dtlc2.tool.ModelChecker.BAQueue=true \
    -XX:+UseParallelGC \
    -Xmx100G tlc2.TLC \
    Governance_TLC.tla \
    -tool -modelcheck -config Governance.cfg -deadlock -workers 54 -checkpoint 0

This:
    - uses the symmetry relation defined in Governance_TLC
    - runs TLC with 54 workers (i.e., 54 cores)
    - uses fingerprint set and queue implementations that are optimized for concurrency
    - allocates 100G heap to the JVM
    - doesn't check for deadlock
    - disables checkpointing

Tip: use tmux or screen such that the analysis doesn't terminate if your SSH connection does

*****************************
Recommended Apalache Workflow
*****************************

Here's the current worfklow using Apalache:

- In VSCode, enable auto-parsing of TLA files on save: Command Palette/Preferences: Configure Language Specific Setting/TLA+/add: 
    "editor.codeActionsOnSave": { "source": true }
  TLA Toolbox probably does automatically
- Pull up all constant definitions before the algorithm in this file, and annotate them with types.
- Use the INSTANCE override in a separate file (Governance_Apalache.tla), and only add type annotations to variables in this file. 
  This way, the VARIABLE declarations don't get overwritten by the PlusCal transpiler.
- Use "apalache-mc typecheck Governance_Apalache.tla" to check the type annotations

Apalache caveats to keep in mind:

1. don't forget the semicolon at the end of each annotation
2. function type annotations use a single arrow ->, operator annotations use the double arrow =>
3. the type system doesn't have sum types (variants). 
   However, it's intentionally unsound to allow heterogeneous lists/sets, like the ones we use for message buffers.
   Both governance_to_ledger and ledger_to_governance can contain values of different types; we type this using a record
   whose fields are the union of all the fields used by the individual message types.

*************
Optimizations
*************

\* TODO: this documentation should be updated to not refer to Merge_Maturity_Of_Neuron
The model deviates from the Rust implementation by (among other things) employing some optimizations.
In particular, validity checks (e.g., in Merge_Maturity_Of_Neuron) over method parameters are often 
moved to the start of the action, such that the choice of the parameters is restricted immediately, 
rather adding an "await" at the same point as where the implementation performs its checks.
This shortens the time needed by TLC to figure out that an action is disabled in a particular state.


***********
Deviations
***********

As of Mar 2024, the model deviates from the Rust implementation in that the model does not have concept
of staked_maturity and spawning state. In more detail:

* The staked_maturity neuron attribute is missing.
* The stake_maturity_of_neuron endpoint is not implemented.
* Neuron spawning state is not tracked.
* spawn_neuron in the model follows the old Rust implementation. The current Rust implementation creates
  the child neuron and moves maturity to it, and then mints maturity later in the canister heartbeat.
  It also handles locks differently.
* merge_neurons in the model has an extra query after the transfer. It checks consistency with the ledger
  balance. This does not happen in the Rust implementation.

\* This models the facts that:
\* 1. In the implementation, the call to the ledger canister may not be atomic.
\*    In particular, when asked to transfer something, the ledger canister might archive transactions, which
\*    introduces interleaving points.
\*    While the archiving is in progress, balance queries might get served in the meantime, meaning that the
\*    results of transfers and queries don't come in the order in which they were issued.
\* 2. The IC interface spec explicitly says that reponses might not be ordered. So while the current IC implementation 
\*    does use queues to order responses, it could change to not order them and still stay compliant to the spec.

\* TODO: we can do disbursing (sanity check)
\* Options:
\* 1. initial state with a neuron with cached stake; 2. first do a claim_neuron

\* Model fees increase/decrease and maturity increase with non-deterministic events;
\* guard for fees increase: shouldn't go higher than cached_stake (and not <0)
\* Properties of claim + disburse (combination)? 
\* Fees of a neuron should be <= to the balance on the ledger
\* Fees of a neuron should be <= to the cached stake?
\* We should somehow make sure that all fees are paid
\* Rewards should not be lost (exception: if they are smaller than the transaction_fee, they can get lost right now)
